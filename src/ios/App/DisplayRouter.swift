/// Decides which physical display each of the Wii U's two screens goes to, and keeps
/// that decision current while the app runs.
///
/// The Wii U has two outputs: the TV and the GamePad (DRC). Cemu models them as two
/// windows, and the Metal renderer keeps a separate `CAMetalLayer` for each. Desktop
/// Cemu lets the user open a second OS window for the GamePad; on iOS the only way to
/// genuinely show two screens at once is a second physical display, so that is what
/// this watches for.
///
/// Three placements, and the log always says which one is in force and why:
///
/// - `.dualScreen` — an external display is connected AND the app has a `UIWindowScene`
///   for it, so we can own a window there. TV goes to the external display, GamePad
///   stays on the device. Both Cemu windows get a real layer.
/// - `.deviceMirrored` — an external display is connected but the app has no scene for
///   it, which is what plain AirPlay/screen mirroring looks like from inside the app:
///   the system is already copying the device's screen to the TV, and the app is not
///   given a separate drawing surface. The TV screen stays on the device (and reaches
///   the TV through the mirror). The GamePad screen is not rendered.
/// - `.deviceOnly` — no external display. TV screen on the device, GamePad screen not
///   rendered.
///
/// **"Not rendered" means no pad surface is registered at all**, not a surface that
/// fails. `MetalRenderer::IsPadWindowActive()` is exactly "the pad layer exists", and
/// every renderer entry point that touches the pad window now tests it first, so the
/// engine skips that work instead of reaching `AcquireDrawable()` and finding nothing.
/// That is the whole point of routing this from one place: there is no configuration
/// in which a Cemu window exists without a layer behind it.
///
/// **What is verified and what is not.** Detection and the `.deviceOnly` path are what
/// runs on a plain iPad and are exercised every launch. The `.dualScreen` path is
/// written against the real UIKit API but has never been exercised — nobody has run
/// this with a display attached, and the app ships no external-display scene
/// configuration, so in practice `externalWindowScene(for:)` is expected to come back
/// nil today and the router to land on `.deviceMirrored`. The log line says which
/// branch was taken; do not assume dual-screen works until a device log shows
/// `placement=dualScreen`.
