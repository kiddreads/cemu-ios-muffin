        // CafeSystem::Initialize(), which runs at TITLE BOOT. Cover art builds a
        // TitleInfo during loadGames at app launch, before any title has booted, so
        // fsc_createMountPath read a null root and dereferenced nodeParent->subnodes.
        // Deterministic, single-threaded, on the first call - which is why it crashed
        // every launch rather than intermittently. Fixed in fsc.cpp by
        // fsc_ensureRootNodes(), which allocates any missing root under that same mutex.

        // thread. It would not, by itself, have fixed a null dereference - the first
        // call still hits it.
        //
        // The correction matters because "fsc.cpp has no locking anywhere" is the kind
