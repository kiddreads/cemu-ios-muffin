/// *clicks* (L3/R3), and Cemu deliberately skips the eight kButtonId_Stick*_ entries in
/// its button loop because VPADRead derives the sticks from get_axis() instead. Sending a
/// direction as a button press is therefore not a rough approximation of a stick - it

/// `x` and `y` are in -1..1 and use the CONSOLE's convention, not the screen's: +x is

/// than per-component, so a diagonal cannot ask for more deflection than the hardware can
/// produce (Cemu normalizes anything longer than 1 anyway; clamping here keeps the number
/// the engine reports equal to the number that was sent).
///
/// Same override semantics as the buttons: it sits in front of any bound physical
/// controller, and a zero on both components hands the stick back to that controller
/// rather than pinning it to centre. So (0,0) is both "released" and "not overridden",
/// which is what lets an MFi stick and the on-screen one coexist.
