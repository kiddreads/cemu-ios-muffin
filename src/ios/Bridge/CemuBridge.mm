// The app crashed on the very first real on-device launch, before any game was even
// tapped - meaning before cemu_bridge_initialize()/CafeSystem::Initialize() ever run.
// Root cause turned out to be a GPU/AGX driver panic (BIF0 page fault), which is NOT
// delivered to the app as a normal POSIX signal - it's a hardware/firmware-level
// event, so the signal handler below is a supplement, not the primary diagnostic.
// The checkpoint trail is what actually matters here: written via synchronous
// write() calls that hit disk immediately, so even an abrupt un-catchable
// termination leaves a record of exactly how far execution got. The signal handler
// is installed via a high-priority (101 - earliest allowed for user code) C++
// constructor rather than from Swift/App init, in case there's also a CPU-side
// crash in one of the ~90 linked Cemu engine libraries' static initializers, which
// run before main() - too early for a Swift-installed handler to catch. Writes to
// Documents/CemuCrashLog.txt - already Finder/Files-visible thanks to
// UIFileSharingEnabled - so it's unambiguously "the" Cemu crash, not some unrelated
// system daemon's diagnostic (which is what happened hunting through iOS's own

// BW-112: ask the kernel whether this process actually gets executable memory,
// instead of assuming it does not.
//
// Every iOS build up to now called LaunchSettings::SetForceInterpreter(true)
// unconditionally a few lines below. That was a bring-up hedge from a point where
// nobody knew whether a sideloaded process can obtain genuine PROT_EXEC pages from
// mmap - which is exactly what Xbyak_aarch64::MmapAllocator::alloc() needs - or
// whether LiveContainer's JIT trick only re-flags pages that were already mapped.
// The question was never answered, only routed around, and the hedge kept shipping.
// Worse, PPCRecompiler.cpp:696 prints "(forced, overriding Multi-core recompiler)"
// whenever that flag is set however it was set, so the launcher named a
// --force-interpreter argument that nobody ever passed. That is why turning JIT on
// in the UI looked like the app lying about it. Answer it at runtime.
//
// The first version of this answered the question by executing the page. That is not
// a probe, it is a coin flip with the process as the stake: on iOS a code-signing
// violation arrives as an uncatchable SIGKILL, so "can we execute our own memory"
// cannot be asked by executing our own memory - a "no" is indistinguishable from the
// app dying. The sentinel meant to make that failure sticky only ever got written on
// the launch that died, and the device log ends exactly there, on "Entering stage 2 -
// calling into the page", on every single launch.
//
// So nothing is executed here any more. Two non-fatal facts are checked instead:
//
//   1. mmap RW + mprotect R+X. If either is refused we have the answer plus an errno,
//      and the recompiler could never work here regardless. The page is never entered.
//   2. csops(CS_OPS_STATUS) & CS_DEBUGGED. Marking a page executable is not the
//      permission that matters on iOS - the kernel checks code signing at the moment
//      of the instruction fetch. CS_DEBUGGED is the flag that waives that check, and
//      it is what every JIT-enabling path on a sideloaded device actually produces (a
//      debugger attached over debugserver, StikJIT/SideStore/LiveContainer arranging
//      the same thing, or a real dynamic-codesigning entitlement). Without it,
//      mprotect(R+X) succeeding means nothing: the jump is still fatal. That is
//      precisely the state this device was in - stage 1 passed, stage 2 was death.
//
// The sentinel stays, but it now guards the thing that is genuinely dangerous: a whole
// boot with the recompiler live, since PPCRecompiler_init() generates and enters real
// code long after this function has returned. It is armed only when JIT is being left
// enabled, and disarmed once a title has actually launched. A sentinel present at
// startup therefore means "the last launch that trusted JIT did not survive it", and
// this install falls back to the interpreter from then on rather than dying forever.
//
// The caveat that must not get lost: the AArch64 recompiler has only ever been proven
// to COMPILE for iOS. It has never executed one instruction on device. A passing check
// makes the JIT testable. It does not make it correct and it does not make it fast.
