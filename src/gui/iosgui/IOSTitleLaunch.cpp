// Real-title launch path for iOS.
//
// Until now the iOS bridge had exactly one way to start anything:
// CafeSystem::PrepareForegroundTitleFromStandaloneRPX(). That is the fallback path
// upstream Cemu uses for a loose executable with "incorrect layout or missing meta
// files" - fine for helloworld.rpx, and incapable of booting a real game. A .wux/.wud
// is an encrypted disc image: it has to be opened through FSTVolume (which finds the
// right AES-128 key in the key cache), registered as a title, and launched by title id
// via CafeSystem::PrepareForegroundTitle(). The picker and the importer have accepted
// .wux/.wud/.wua/.iso for a while; this is the part that was missing behind them.
//
// Keys are the user's own and are never shipped, derived or guessed. Cemu reads them
// from keys.txt in the user data directory (Documents/mlc/keys.txt on iOS) - dumped
// from the console the user owns - and FSTVolume::FindDiscKey() simply tries each one
// against the disc header until a decrypt comes out as zeroes. With no keys.txt, or
// with keys that do not match, nothing here can open a disc image, and the boot fails
// with a reason that says exactly that instead of a black screen. Homebrew (.rpx) is
// unaffected and still needs no keys at all.
//
// Why this lives here and not in CemuBridge.mm: the bridge is compiled by Xcode
// directly, and TitleInfo.h/TitleList.h pull in pugixml, ZArchive and the config stack.
// The same reasoning already applied to IOSInput_* and IOSWindowSystem_GetLastFPS() -
// keep anything header-heavy inside the CMake build, which already has those include
// paths and the precompiled header, and expose a flat function the bridge can declare
// in one line.

// Adopt a keys.txt the user dropped into Documents/keys/.
//
// The engine reads keys from ActiveSettings::GetUserDataPath("keys.txt"), which on iOS
// resolves to Documents/mlc/keys.txt. That path is correct for the engine and useless
// as an instruction to a person: mlc is the emulated console's storage and is full of
// engine state, so "put your keys in there" means picking the right directory out of a
// pile. Documents/keys/ exists so there is exactly one plainly named folder, visible in
// Files.app via UIFileSharingEnabled, whose only job is to receive keys.txt.
//
// Adopted by copying rather than by repointing the engine, because KeyCache_Prepare()
// builds its path from GetUserDataPath() in code shared with every other platform.
// Copying keeps that untouched and is free in practice - a keys.txt is a few hundred
// bytes. Doing it immediately before every key read (rather than once at startup) is
// what makes a file dropped mid-session work without relaunching the app, which is the
// same reason KeyCache_Reload() is called on every launch attempt.
//
// The drop folder wins when both files exist: it is the one the user can see and edit,
// so it is the one their last action was performed on. When only the engine copy exists
// - a keys.txt imported through Settings before this folder existed - it is seeded into
// the drop folder instead, so those keys become visible rather than silently staying in
// mlc. After that first seed the drop file always exists and the drop folder wins from
// then on, so the two rules cannot ping-pong.
